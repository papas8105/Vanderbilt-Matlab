# Vanderbilt-Matlab
This is a course on coursera,introducing basic programming skills.
There are two version the one is the 2014 (old version) and the other one is the 2016 version of the course. In each folder there is a mix between my solutions and the official solutions. In 'My Explanations' I will provide some explanations for the most difficult problems encountered if someone asks me to do so and have the time to do it.
